# AlgorithmsProject2
Second Project from my Algorithms course

This project involved calculating the largest fibonacci number that contained 100 digits. I could not find a data type that was large enough to store that integer
so I made an addition algorithm that adds to integer arrays where each array index contains each digit of the two numbers being added. This allowed me to create 
a data type that was large enough to store the number I needed.
